/* Initialize harmonic constituent arrays. These each hold 37 values for
the tide site that was extracted using the R scripts:
tide_harmonics_parse.R and tide_harmonics_library_generator.R

The values are available from NOAA's http://tidesandcurrent.noaa.gov site.
Kappa here is referred to as 'Phase' on NOAA's site. The order of the
constituents is shown below in the names. Unfortunately this does not match
NOAA's order, so you will have to rearrange NOAA's values if you want to
put new site values in here by hand.
The Speed, Equilarg and Nodefactor arrays can all stay the same for any site.
